Command-Line-Tool
=================

The command line tool operates a phonebook allowing users basic operations, such as add, remove, lookup, modify and delete entries in a phonebook. 

This was a fun exercise as it allowed me to explore and learn about python magic methods, notably the __setitem__, __getitem__ and __delitem__ methods.
